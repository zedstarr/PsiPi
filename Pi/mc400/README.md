Files written from the MC400 OPL progs go in the EMAIL/INBOX, TWEET/INBOX or IMAGE/INBOX subfolders here.

The shell scripts mc400_watch_email/tweet/image.sh detect these files being written and do the appropriate processing.

After processing time+date-tagged copies are placed in EMAIL/OUTBOX, TWEET/OUTBOX or IMAGE/OUTBOX.
