This file contains details of options and commands for MCLINK.EXE.
See your 3 Link manual for full instructions on getting started.

MCLINK requires DOS version 3.2 or above.


Commands provided in MCLINK
---------------------------

When you start up the MCLINK program, the lower window contains a $
prompt. At this prompt you can enter various commands. These commands
cover:

   1  file-handling
   2  changing the communications settings
   3  exiting the MCLINK program
   4  displaying the version of MCLINK

For all these commands:
 
 - the command can be abbreviated, to a minimum of the first two
   letters, e.g. DE for DELETE, RE for RENAME, CO for COPY.

 - CTRL-C stops the command (though in multiple file operations, some
   files may already have been copied, deleted etc. before the command
   is stopped). 

It is recommended that you read the `Files and disks' chapter in the
Series 3 User Guide before using the commands described below.



1  File-handling commands: DIR, COPY, RENAME, DELETE, MKDIR
-----------------------------------------------------------
Usually you would use the various file options on the Series 3; but for
certain operations you might choose to use the file-handling commands
within MCLINK on the PC instead. Note that in all these commands:

 - if no directory is specified, the current directory is assumed.
 - if no device is specified, the current device is assumed.
 - if no filing system is specified, the PC is assumed.


Full file names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In MCLINK the syntax of full file names on the PC or Series 3 is:

      filing system::device:\directory\sub-directory\file.extension

When specifying a directory or sub-directory in the file-handling
commands, make sure to add a \ onto the end of the directory name.
Otherwise the directory name will be taken as a filename. So:

      COPY A:\*.* REM::\LETTERS is wrong - it would try to copy the
      files in the root directory of A: to the file LETTERS.

      COPY A:\*.* REM::\LETTERS\ is right - it would copy the files
      on A: to the directory LETTERS.

In MCLINK on the PC, `filing system' is
      LOC:: for files on the PC (local)
   or REM:: for files on the Series 3 (remote)

On the Series 3 the situation is reversed, with LOC:: being the
Series 3, and REM:: being the PC.

If you do not specify a filing system in a file specification, LOC::
is used.

On the Series 3, A: and B: are the SSD drives, and M: is the internal
disk. A device connected to the expansion port may or may not provide
a C: drive.


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

DIR - lists files in the specified directory

Syntax: DIR directory

*  The directory may be on the remote or local filing system - e.g.
   DIR A:\LETTERS\ looks in directory LETTERS on the disk in drive A:
   of the PC, DIR REM::A:\NOTES\ looks in the NOTES directory on the
   SSD in drive A: of the Series 3.

*  Use wildcards to list only certain files - e.g.
   DIR *.TXT to list just the .TXT files in the current directory.

When you get a directory listing with the DIR command, the following
file information is given:

   file name and extension
   date and time when the file was last modified
   size of file in bytes

and a combination of these indicators as appropriate:

   Mod     file has been modified since last sent
   RdO     read-only file
   Sys     system file
   Hid     hidden file

Example: CLIENTS.DBF      14/01/90  09:54:23  544  Mod RdO

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

COPY - copies specified files to the specified device and directory

Syntax: COPY filename1 filename2

Optional flags:
   -i   include sub-directories
        If there are any files copied from subdirectories they are
        placed in directories below the current directory to reflect
        the source directory structure.

   -m   modified files only

   e.g. COPY REM::A:\*.* -i -m copies all modified files in all
   directories of the SSD in drive A: on the Series 3 to the PC.

Examples:

   COPY REM::M:\*.TXT \BACKUP\ would copy all the .TXT files
   from the internal disk of the Series 3 to the BACKUP directory
   on the PC.

   COPY \SMITH\*.DOC REM::A:\LETTERS\ would copy all the .DOC files
   from the SMITH directory on the PC to directory LETTERS on
   the SSD in drive A: of the Series 3.

*  If you do not supply a complete destination name, the root 
   directory and/or default disk on the Series 3 is assumed, and the
   source filename is used as the destination filename.
   E.g. COPY \HOME\SECURE.TXT REM::M: would copy SECURE.TXT to the
   M:\ directory on the Series 3, giving the file the name SECURE.TXT.

*  If you do not supply a complete source name, the current
   device/directory is assumed - e.g. COPY *.TXT REM::M:\ copies files
   from the current directory on the PC to the root directory of the Series 3's
   internal disk.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

RENAME - renames the specified file

Syntax: RENAME filename1 filename2

*  You can rename a file in any directory on any drive on the PC
   or Series 3 - e.g.
   RENAME DETAILS.DOC DETAILS2.DOC
   RENAME REM::M:\CLIENTS.DBF REM::M:\BUSINESS.DBF

*  You can rename more than one file at a time, e.g.
   RENAME REM::M:\*.TXT REM::M:\*.DOC

*  You cannot rename a file across directories or devices, so:
   RENAME REM::M:\LETTER1.TXT REM::B:\LETTER2.TXT
   would give an error. Instead, copy the file to the new name
   and destination then delete the old file.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

DELETE - deletes specified file

Syntax: DELETE filename

Optional flag:
   -i   delete files of the same name in sub-directories
   e.g. DEL *.TXT -i would delete all .TXT files in the current
   directory and in any sub-directories of the current directory.

*  You can delete files from any directory on the PC or Series 3.

*  You can delete more than one file at a time by using wildcards.

*  You cannot delete directories with this command.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

MKDIR - makes a directory

Syntax: MKDIR directory

*  Makes a subdirectory of the current directory.

*  You can make directories on any drive of the PC or Series 3.

*  You can make more than one subdirectory at a time - e.g.
   MKDIR \HOME\LETTERS makes the subdirectory \HOME\LETTERS and the
   intermediate subdirectory \HOME (if it does not exist).

2  Changing the communications settings
---------------------------------------

The SET command in MCLINK allows you to:

        use either of the PC's serial ports,
        change the Baud rate at which your Series 3 and PC communicate

Following the SET command you can specify a variety of options. For
example:

         SET -p1 -b9600       selects COM 1, 9600 baud
         SET -p2              selects COM 2

SET options:

   Serial port: -p1 or -p2 selects COM 1 or 2

   Baud rate: -b followed by a number sets the baud rate. You will
   need to change the Baud rate on the Series 3 to match, by using
   the `Remote link' option in the System screen.

IMPORTANT:
When MCLINK is run, it looks for a file MCLINK.TRM in the current
directory which holds the communication options. For the Series 3, an
MCLINK.TRM is provided, which sets 9600 Baud.

If an MCLINK.TRM is not found, the default settings are used. The SET
command creates a new MCLINK.TRM in the current directory to hold the
new settings.

Default settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use the default settings, ensure that there is no MCLINK.TRM in
the current directory - by renaming or deleting it, or changing to a
different directory. The default settings are:

    -p1 -b19200       (serial port 1, 19200 baud)

To return to the default settings, type SET

Examples of the SET command:

   SET -b1200		            1200 baud
                                    
   SET -p1 -b2400		    port 1, 2400 Baud.



3  Exiting the MCLINK program
-----------------------------

   Type EXIT to return to DOS.


4  Display the version of MCLINK
--------------------------------

   Type VER to display the version number.


Single floppy disk drive PCs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If your PC has only one floppy disk drive (currently
   referenced as `A:'), and you mistakenly enter DIR B: while 
   in the MCLINK program, the program will be halted by DOS,
   requesting you to insert a disk into B:.

   To avoid this, use the DOS ASSIGN command before running the 
   MCLINK program, like this:

      ASSIGN B=A (Enter)

   Then DIR B: will be read as DIR A: and the program will not 
   be halted. See your DOS manual for further details of the 
   ASSIGN command.


Additional Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following enhancements have been made:

    1  running programs on a Series 3
    2  running multiple commands
    3  initial command line processing

1  Running programs on the Series 3
-----------------------------------

RUN - makes a program run on the Series 3.

Syntax: RUN program name, program command line

*  The program name is assumed to specify a valid executable for the
   Series 3. The program may exist on either computer; in order to
   force the Series 3 to run a copy of the program held on the PC,
   you should prefix the program name with 'REM::'

*  The program command line is as required by the program being
   invoked.

Examples of the RUN command:

    RUN CLOCK.IMG will run a copy of CLOCK.IMG on the Series 3.
    The program is assumed to exist in the root directory of the
    default disk.

    RUN REM::CLOCK.IMG will run a copy of CLOCK.IMG on the PC.
    The program is assumed to exist in the default path on the PC.

2  Running multiple commands
----------------------------

   MCLINK can read a text file containing multiple commands:

*  Any line in the file containing a '!' is assumed to be a comment
   line and is ignored.

*  Any blank line is ignored.

*  You may specify almost any MCLINK command, although some may be
   meaningless in this environment - DIR, for example.

*  The SET command should not be used.

To invoke, type the '@' character immediately followed by the name of 
the text file containing the commands.

Example:

   If the file 'SEND_ALL.TXT' contains the following lines:

        ! Sends all text files to the Series 3 after
        ! creating the correct directory, then exits

        MKDIR REM::M:\NOTES\
        COPY *.TXT REM::M:\NOTES\
        COPY *.DOC REM::M:\NOTES\
        EXIT

   then entering '@SEND_ALL.TXT' at the '$' prompt will cause the
   \NOTES\ directory to be created in the internal memory of the Series
   3, all the .TXT and .DOC files in the current directory to be copied
   to this \NOTES\, then MCLINK to exit.

3  Initial command line processing
----------------------------------

   MCLINK now understands a command line entered when running MCLINK
   from the DOS prompt. The command line may take the form of the 
   parameters to the SET command, a file name assumed to be a 
   configuration file, or the @ command to run a sequence of commands.

Examples:
 
   MCLINK -p2 -b9600 will run MCLINK using port 2 at 9600 baud. No 
   .TRM file will be created, unlike the SET command, and any future
   running of the MCLINK program will not use these parameters.
   
   MCLINK S3SETUP will run MCLINK forcing it to use the file
   S3SETUP.TRM as the initial configuration file. This file would
   typically have been created by a previous use of the SET command 
   within MCLINK.

   MCLINK @SEND_ALL.TXT will run MCLINK and cause the initial
   commands to be read from the file SEND_ALL.TXT. MCLINK will
   wait until a connection to the Series 3 has been established
   before running any of the commands.
