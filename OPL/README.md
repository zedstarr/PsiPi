The OPL programs to run on the MC400 to realise sending of simple tweets and emails along with conversion of screenshots from the MC ('SCREEN.PIC' files) taken using the Psion-Crtl-Shift-S keypress.

.OPL source, .OPO translated and .ICN (icon files needed if .OPOs are installed in the System Screen) files included.

In the OPL there are numerous references to "PsiBridge" - this is the hostname of the Pi I've used ;-)
